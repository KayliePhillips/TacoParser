Taco Parser 

This is an example exercise in geolocation, csv parsing, and logging.

You are given a CSV file containing TacoBell locations in Alabama and you need to find which two locations are the farthest apart.  This console application will parse thorough the file and find the two location based on their latitude and longitude.  Test Driven Development (TDD) is used to ensure features properly operated before continuing to build the code.  The final result will tell you the two Taco Bells furthest away from each other in miles.
